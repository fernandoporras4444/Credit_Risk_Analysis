# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview:
The purpose of this project was to use different Machine Learning techniques to train and evaulate models with unbalanced classes pertaining to credit risk. Using credit card credit dataset from LendingClub to build 4 models with 2 oversampling algorithms of using Random Over Sample and SMOTE, 1 undersampling algorithm using Cluster Centroids, and 1 over/undersampling algorithm using SMOTEEN. Also add 2 additional models that reduce bias usning Balanced Random Forest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier algrothims.
